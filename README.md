### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is the code for my personal website. Feel free to take look around.

I've coded pretty much evertyhing from scratch. If you can't already tell, I'm one of thooooose people who strongly beleive that "designers should learn to code". In my experience, learning to code has really helped my grow and improve as a designer.

I'm using (Next.js)[https://nextjs.org/], which is a React framework for building websites and webapps.
